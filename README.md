# St. Paul Crime REST API

A RESTful web server providing access to St. Paul crime incident data using Node.js, Express, and SQLite3.

---

## INSTALLATION AND SETUP

Follow these steps exactly to get the server running:

### STEP 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FlamingMachTurtle/webdev-rest
cd webdev-rest
```

### STEP 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install:
- express (web framework)
- sqlite3 (database driver)
- cors (cross-origin support)

### STEP 3: Download and Setup Database

**IMPORTANT:** The database file is NOT included in this repository. You must download it separately.

1. Download `stpaul_crime.sqlite3` from: https://github.com/tmarrinan/webdev-rest
2. Create a `db` folder in the project root (if it doesn't exist):
   ```bash
   mkdir db
   ```
3. Move the downloaded database file into the `db` folder:
   ```bash
   mv ~/Downloads/stpaul_crime.sqlite3 db/
   ```

Your folder structure should look like this:
```
webdev-rest/
├── db/
│   └── stpaul_crime.sqlite3    <-- Database file goes here
├── rest_server.mjs
├── package.json
└── ...
```

### STEP 4: Start the Server

```bash
node rest_server.mjs
```

### STEP 5: Verify It's Running

You should see this output:
```
Now listening on port 8000
Now connected to stpaul_crime.sqlite3
```

The server is now running at: **http://localhost:8000**

Test it by opening this URL in your browser or running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/codes
```

## Tips

1. **Make a backup of the database** before testing PUT/DELETE operations
2. **Use query parameters** to filter large result sets
3. **Check response status codes** to handle errors properly
4. **Use the limit parameter** to avoid loading too many incidents at once
